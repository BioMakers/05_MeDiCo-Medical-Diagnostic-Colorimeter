## Synopsis

This project will aim to develop a low-cost colorimeter to detect colour changes in medical diagnostic assays, such as those for infectious diseases. The system will be intended for use in resource poor settings with the aim of improving diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity by removing user subjectivity from the interpretation of the test result. The system will be open-source and take a range of sample types to allow it to be easily adaptable to a large variety of colorimetric diagnostic assays.

## Software

Explain functionality of software components (if any) as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Ideally, this should be pseudo code or an abstract graphical representation of your code e.g entity relationship diagram. Consider adding a screenshot of your User Interface.

## Hardware

Explain how the hardware components (if any) of your project function as concisely as possible, including a short description of fabrication and assembly. Component suppliers and part numbers should be provided separately in a bill of materials, in a 'Hardware Folder'.

## Installation, Maintenance and Testing Guide

Provide instructions on usage, describe a test scheme and show how to run the tests with code and hardware configuration examples with some representative results.
